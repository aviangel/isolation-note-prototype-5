      <h1 class="nhsuk-heading-l">You do not need an isolation note</h1>
      <p>You can only get an isolation note if you have been told to self-isolate because:
        <ul>
          <li>you have symptoms of coronavirus</li>
          <li>you live with someone who has symptoms of coronavirus</li>
          <li>you are in a support bubble with someone who has symptoms of coronavirus</li>
          <li>you have been told to self-isolate by a test and trace service</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">If you are at higher risk from coronavirus</h2>
      <p>If you are at higher risk from coronavirus, work from home if possible. Your employer should support you to do this.</p>
      <p>If you cannot work from home and are concerned about having to go to work, talk to your employer. Employers should make sure suitable arrangements are in place so you can go in to work.</p>
